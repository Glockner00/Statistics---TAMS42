(i)  Once you have chosen c, draw a figure containing both the region I and the rectangle.



(ii) To estimate |I|, we use the Monte Carlo method. First, let n = 20 and we now generate n uniform
     random variables in the rectangle (a, b) Ã— (0, c). To do this, write commands in the R-file:

==== n=20 ====
area = 0.175
f_n = 7L
table = 0.5675

(iii) Repeat the whole process for n = 50, n = 500 and then for n = 10000. When n increases, is the
      estimated area getting closer to the (almost) accurate area?


==== n=50 ====
area = 0.19
f_n = 19L

==== n=500 ====
area = 0.191
f_n = 191L

==== n=10000 ====
area = 0.19175
f_n = 3835L
